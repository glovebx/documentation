   consecutive contracts during their employment.

Here are several key contractual information to take note during setup:

- :guilabel:`Salary Structue Type`: Set as CAP57: Hong Kong Employee. 
- :guilabel:`Work Entry Source`: You may choose between **Working Schedule**, **Attendances** or **Planning**. 
   This field determines how the **working hours** and **days** are accounted for in

   - :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: The work entries are generated automatically based on the 
      employee's Working Schedule.
   - :guilabel:`Attendances`: The work entries will be generated based on the check-in/-out period 
      logged on the Attendances app.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-contract.png
   :alt: Hong Kong employment contract

Running your payslips
---------------------
Once the employee and contracts are setup, you can proceed with the creation of the payslip in the 
**Payroll** app. 

Odoo provides **four** different salary structures under CAP57 Regulation:

#. :guilabel:`Employees Monthly Pay`: To process the monthly employee salary.
#. :guilabel:`Payment in Lieu of Notice`: To process final payment upon contract termination.
#. :guilabel:`Long Service Payment`: Applicable to employees with more than 5 years of service upon 
   contract termination.
#. :guilabel:`Severance Payment`: Applicable to employees with more than 2 years of service upon 
   contract termination.

Before running the payslips, you can adjust the accounts used in relation to the salary rule by
navigating to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Configurations --> Rules`. 

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-salary-rules.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Salary Rules

Odoo can create pay runs in **two** ways: via **individual** or via **batch** payslips.

Batch payslips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Payslips --> Batches`
This method of payslip generation is used for recurring payments as you can manage the payslip for 
multiple employees at once. 

#. Click on :guilabel:`New`.
#. Provide a Batch Name (e.g, `2024 â€“ Jan`) and Period (e.g. 01/01/2024 - 01/31/2024)
#. Click on :guilabel:`Generate Payslips`.
#. You can choose which Salary Structure you wish to generate the payslips for this batch. The 
   department filter allows you to designate the batch for a specific group of employees.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Generate`.
#. Now you can see the :guilabel:`Payslips` smart button created automatically.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-batch-payslips.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Batch Payslips

Once you are satisfied with the Payslips, click :guilabel:`Create Draft entry` to generate a draft 
accounting journal entry found in the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab of the payslip. 
Note for batches, this accounting entry will sum up balances from all payslips.

Individual payslips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to :menuselection:`Payroll --> Payslips --> All Payslips`
This method of payslip generation is commonly used to handle one-off payments (e.g. Payment in Lieu
 of Notice, Long Service Payment, Severance Payment).

#. Click on :guilabel:`New`.
#. Select an :guilabel:`Employee`; their :guilabel:`Contract` will be filled out automatically
#. Add a pay :guilabel:`Period`
#. Select a salary :guilabel:`Structure` (e.g. Employees Monthly Pay)
#. The **Worked Days** tab will automatically compute the worked days/hours and time-off leaves
   that are applicable.
#. You may also choose to add additional payslip items (e.g. Commissions, Deductions) under the 
   **Other Inputs** section.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Compute Sheet` button to generate payslip lines. This button will refresh the 
   :guilabel:`Salary Computation` tab. 

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-individual-payslip.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Individual Payslip

.. note::
   If you have amended the work entry for an employee, you will need to go to the **gear icon (âš™)**
   and click on **Recompute Whole Sheet** to refresh the payslip's **Worked Day** section. 

The :guilabel:`Salary Computation` tab will show the detailed breakdown of the computation based on 
the salary rules configured for the structure type. 

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-salary-computation.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Salary computation

#. **Rent Allowance**: Amount derived from the employee's active rental record.
#. **Basic salary**: Amount from which tax-deductible lines can be subtracted minus rental 
   allowance (if any).
#. **713 Gross**: Amount after considering allowances/deductions.
#. **MPF Gross**
#. **Employee Mandatory Contribution**: Employee MPF Contribution
#. **Employer Mandatory Contribution**: Employer MPF Contribution
#. **Gross**
#. **Net Salary**: Final amount to be paid to the employee
#. **Monthly End Autopay**
#. **Other Lines**: depends on whether there are any salary attachments to the employee. 

.. note::
   Do note there will be no MPF computation line for the first month payslip as the **employee** 
   contribution starts on 2nd month onwards.
   The **employer** contribution for the 2nd month will include the back-pay for the first month. 

Once you are satisfied with the Payslips, click :guilabel:`Create Draft entry` to generate a draft 
accounting journal entry found in the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab of the payslip. 

Paying your employees
---------------------
Once the draft journal entries have been posted, the company can now pay the employees.
The user can choose between **two** different **payment methods**. 

- From the employee's payslip (:menuselection:`Payroll --> Payslips`), once the payslip's journal
  entry has been posted, click :guilabel:`Register Payment`. The process is the same as
  :doc:`paying vendor bills <../accounting/payments>`: select the desired bank journal and payment
  method, then later reconcile the payment with the corresponding bank statement.

- For batch payments, you can click on **Create HSBC Autopay Report** and fill in following: 
  This will create an **.apc** file format which you can upload to HSCB portal. 

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-generate-autopay.png

By Attendances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this section, we will show you how to handle employees who are based on hourly-wage contract.

.. note::
   Make sure the employee contract is using **Attendance** as the Work Entry Source and the Wage 
   Type is set to **Hourly Wage**. 

#. Go to **Attendance** app.
#. The employee can check-in/out via the kiosk mode. 
#. In the **Payroll** app, you can review the attendace work entries generated from 
   :menuselection:`Payroll --> Work Entries`. 
#. Next, you can generate the payslip as per earlier steps and process payment as per usual.

Taking Time-Off
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The work entry types and time-off types are fully integrated between the **Time-off** and 
**Payroll** app. There are several time-off types and work entry types specific to HK which are 
installed automatically along with the **HK-Payroll** module. 

There are two checkboxes to take note when setting up the work entry type:

- :guilabel:`Use 713`: This leave type to be included as part of 713 computation.
- :guilabel:`Non-full pay`: 80% of the :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)`. 

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-work-entry-type.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Work Entry Type

Understanding 713
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our HK Payroll module is compliant with 713 Ordinance which relates to the 
:abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` computation to ensure fair compensation for employees. 

The ADW computation is as follows:
.. image:: hong_kong/hk-adw.png
   :alt: Hong Kong ADW Formula

.. note::
   For 418 compliance, there is no automatation to allocate the :abbr:`SH (Statutory Holiday)` 
   entitlement to the employees. As soon as your employees meets the 418 requirements, you may 
   manually allocate the leaves via the **Time-Off** app. 

You may generate the following payslips (make sure payslip status is **Done**) and test them out:
